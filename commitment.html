				<h3>
					Throwing an Anti Valentines Day Party - for one
				</h3>
				<ol>
					<li class="olli"><b>Hand out black roses, play singles games, and have people exchange gag gifts.</b></li>
						<ul>
							<li class="lili">You may have heard of divorce parties, so why not borrow from the concept on Valentine's Day? Alternatively, have a theme that is pointedly not about Valentine's Day. For instance, a party with a color theme, Country Western, Marshmallow Appreciation Day....whatever.</li>
							<li class="lili">Order a Valentine's Day pi√±ata, and let everyone take turns smacking it a time or two. Make sure there's something fun inside. Have fun with the drinks. How about a blood orange mojito?</li>
							<li class="enli">Spend some time developing fun anti-Valentine's Day invitations. You don't have to avoid red or pink or little hearts. You just have to have the right slogans on them. Custom-order candy hearts with sarcastic phrases about love and Cupid.</li>
						</ul>
					<li class="olli"> <b>Order an anti-Valentine's Day cake or cupcake or whatever dessert you feel like.</b></li>
						<ul>
							<li class="lili">You can find funny but sarcastic cupcake or cake toppers online and in some party stores. For example, a broken glitter heart would work.</li>
							<li class="lili">It's all in the slogan. Be funny, but not too mean. Cupid is stupid, love hurts, or other phrases are harmless fun. There are many anti-Valentine's Day cupcake recipes online. For example, some recommend creating a red licorice X on top of the cupcake.</li>
							<li class="enli">You could top the cake with black hearts or black roses. The color black is a great way to turn a red Valentine's Day cake or party into an anti-Valentine's Day message.</li>
						</ul>
					<li class="olli"><b>Go out to a fancy dinner for yourself, by yourself.</b></li>
						<ul>
							<li class="lili">You could enjoy a Valentine's Day special with someone, you, and even see if any restaurants (or taverns) offer anti-Valentine's day events or dinners. Some do. </li>
							<li class="lili">Reach out to someone you know is lonely. Send them a bouquet or invite them over for dinner. Just kidding, they'll probably feel bad that you feel bad, instead give your pet some nice treats because no one loves you as much as them.</li>
							<li class="enli">Even better, take your pet out and have a picnic, or go to a pet-friendly restaurant that can give them a treat too. You know you want to.</li>
						</ul>
					<li class="olli"><b>Pranking never hurt anyone! Unless they know you who are and well...</b></li>
						<ul>
							<li class="lili">Why not prank call your exes or your exes new partner and mess with their holliday because let's get real, you're really just lowkey jealous and a bit evil.</li>
							<li class="enli">You could also send a bouquet of flower or edible arrangements as a side piece, to a friend or ex who you know has a partner. Hopefully they don't take it the wrong way.</li>
						</ul>
					<li class="olli"><b>Give yourself a spa day, duhhh.</b></li>
						<ul>
							<li class="lili">Get a nice relaxing bath bomb and take a stress-relieving bath. While your're at it, you might as well watch a movie and drink some white wine as if you were really at a spa. Honestly just do this once a month, self care is the best care.</li>
							<li class="enli">On the other hand, if you got some extra money, screw it and go to an actual spa, get one of those special couple deals but take your bestie instead, hopefully they're single too. You can then bitch about anyone or anything you like all while you destress.</li>
						</ul>
					<li class="olli"><b>Sell your stuff, or your ex's stuff they left behind.</b></li>
						<ul>
							<li class="lili">Listen, it's their fault they forgot about it anyways so instead of burning it, you might as well make a profit out of it. Take that ring they gave you and pawn it, their spouse won't mind, or go to Plato's Closet and sell the clothes they gave you because ... well why not, it's cash.</li>
							<li class="enli">With the money you now have, you can literally do anything that is mentioned above! It's a win-win if I've ever written one.</li>
						</ul>
					<li class="olli"><b>Last, but not least, send anti Valentine's valentines.</b></li>
						<ul>
							<li class="lili">Hear me out, this is the most petty thing ever, but you're already chilling at home with some hot chocolate adn a bouquet of flowers from you to you, so why not make someone else's day better by ruining it with annoying valentines.</li>
							<li class="enli">You can just scroll down Twitter and see a myriad of these floating around so you can print them or re-do them with cute decorations to get their hopes up. </li>
						</ul>
