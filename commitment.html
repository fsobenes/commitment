					Throwing an Anti Valentines Day Party - for one
				</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Hand out black roses, play singles games, and have people exchange gag gifts.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>You may have heard of divorce parties, so why not borrow from the concept on Valentine's Day? Alternatively, have a theme that is pointedly not about Valentine's Day. For instance, a party with a color theme, Country Western, Marshmallow Appreciation Day....whatever.</li>
							<li>Order a Valentine's Day pi√±ata, and let everyone take turns smacking it a time or two. Make sure there's something fun inside. Have fun with the drinks. How about a blood orange mojito?</li>
							<li>Spend some time developing fun anti-Valentine's Day invitations. You don't have to avoid red or pink or little hearts. You just have to have the right slogans on them. Custom-order candy hearts with sarcastic phrases about love and Cupid.</li>
